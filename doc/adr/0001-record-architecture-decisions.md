# 1. Record architecture decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a lightweight, durable way to record significant decisions about the architecture and product scope of this app, so that the maintainer and coding agents can understand why things are the way they are without having to reconstruct the reasoning from agent chat sessions or commit messages.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), as described by Michael Nygard in [Documenting Architecture Decisions](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

ADRs live in `doc/adr/`, numbered sequentially (`NNNN-title-in-kebab-case.md`). Each ADR has a short, fixed structure: Status, Context, Decision, Consequences.

Decisions are deliberated before implementation, and the pull request is the review. An ADR is therefore added with status "Accepted" in the same pull request that implements the decision; there is no separate "Proposed" stage.

ADRs are immutable once accepted. To change a decision, write a new ADR that supersedes or amends the old one; mark the old one's status as "Superseded by NNNN" or "Amended by NNNN" rather than editing its content. The status line is the only part of an accepted ADR that may change.

## Consequences

- The reasoning behind non-obvious decisions is captured close to the code, in the repo, and reviewed like any other change.
- Agents and the maintainer have a chronological record of how the architecture evolved.
- Small overhead per decision (a few paragraphs of writing) — only worth doing for decisions with non-trivial consequences or trade-offs. Day-to-day implementation choices do not need an ADR.
